# QuestionAnsweringModelNLP
This model is designed to answer simple quizes based on text similarity via word tokenization. 
Each question has 4 answer options and one correct answer.
Here I used different ways of tokenization and different similarity measures so that my model could show the highest accuracy in question answering.
